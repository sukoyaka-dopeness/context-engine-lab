# Philosophy Deconstruction Template

*For topics where the central disagreement involves value frameworks, interpretive methodology,*  
*or genuinely unresolvable aporia.*

*This template makes the structure of philosophical disagreement visible without forcing a verdict.*

---

## When to Use This Template

Use this template — instead of or in addition to the standard topic template — when:

1. First-order discussion has reached impasse
2. The impasse appears to be caused by differing frameworks, not differing evidence
3. The topic is in `humanities`, `philosophy`, or involves primarily `normative` claims

**Meta-rule:**  
Do not use this template before first-order discussion has been attempted.  
Meta-layer transition should be triggered by impasse, not used as a shortcut.  
Frequent meta-escapes read as avoidance.

---

## Step 1: Question Formulation

Restate the topic as an explicit question or set of questions.  
Avoid framing that presupposes an answer.

**Central question:**

**Sub-questions (if any):**

---

## Step 2: First-Order Positions

What are the primary positions, and what reasoning or evidence supports each?  
Include sources, methodology, and historical context where available.

### Position A
- **Summary:**
- **Supporting reasoning or sources:**
- **Methodology:**
- **Historical context:**

### Position B
- **Summary:**
- **Supporting reasoning or sources:**
- **Methodology:**
- **Historical context:**

## Step 3: Impasse Detection

At what point does the disagreement stop being about evidence and start being about frameworks?  
Identify this transition explicitly.

> *"This question is partly about [empirical or factual element], but the remaining disagreement appears to depend on which values or frameworks one starts from."*

**Explicit disclosure — display this text verbatim:**

> *"The following section involves framework comparison. Framework selection is itself influenced by cultural and political context. No framework listed here is endorsed by this platform."*

## Step 4: Framework Mapping

Which ethical or interpretive frameworks lead to which conclusions on this topic?

| Framework | Implication for this topic |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Utilitarianism | |
| Virtue Ethics | |
| Deontology (Kantian) | |
| Care Ethics | |
| Contractualism | |
| [Other relevant framework] | |

**Curation note:**  
The list of frameworks is itself a curatorial decision.  
Deciding which frameworks to include, and in which order, carries implicit assumptions.  
If a relevant framework is missing, open an Issue with label `framework-proposal`.  
The framework list for this topic is considered permanently open for revision.

---

## Step 5: Framework Selection as a Topic

When framework selection is itself contested, make it explicit:

> *"Which framework to apply to [this topic] is not a neutral choice. It is itself a question this platform treats as open."*

If a topic on framework selection does not yet exist, flag for creation:  
- [ ] Framework selection for this topic needs its own content page

---

## Step 6: Aporia Record

What cannot be resolved, even with full information and good faith engagement?  
State it explicitly. Do not soften it.

**Aporia:**

> *"This question remains open. The difficulty of resolving it is itself informative — it reveals the structure of the disagreement more clearly than a forced resolution would."*

**Archive note:**  
Aporia entries are added to the Aporia Archive.  
Unresolvable questions are not failures. They are data.
