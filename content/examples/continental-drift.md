## One-Line Summary

The theory that Earth's continents move over geological time — proposed by Wegener in 1912 and rejected for decades before seafloor spreading provided a plausible mechanism — is one of the most thoroughly documented cases of a correct scientific hypothesis facing sustained expert rejection before eventually achieving universal consensus.

## Forewarning Assessment

**Forewarning Box: DO NOT DISPLAY**

*Rationale: Continental drift and plate tectonics are not contested in the scientific literature. The prior fixed-continent consensus has been completely replaced. This topic is included not because the evidence is currently disputed, but because the history of resistance to Wegener's hypothesis is pedagogically significant for understanding how mechanism requirements shape scientific acceptance.*

## Consensus Messaging

> *"Plate tectonics is the unifying framework of modern geology. Continental movement, seafloor spreading, and subduction are established beyond scientific dispute. Source: Vine & Matthews (1963); Le Pichon (1968). This represents a completed paradigm shift — the prior fixed-continent model has been replaced entirely."*

## Primary Sources

### Source A

- **Year:** 1912
- **Peer-reviewed:** Yes (by standards of the time)
- **Citations:** Historically foundational; citation count not meaningful for 1912 publication
- **Replication status:** Core claim — that continents move — subsequently confirmed by multiple independent lines of evidence; original paper predates mechanism
- **Summary:** First systematic presentation of continental drift hypothesis. Assembles evidence from geological fit of continental margins, fossil distribution, paleoclimate indicators, and rock type matching across oceans. Does not identify a mechanism — a gap that drove decades of rejection.

### Source B
- **Citation:** Vine, F.J. & Matthews, D.H. (1963). Magnetic Anomalies Associated with Oceanic Ridges. *Nature*, 199(4897), 947–949.
- **Year:** 1963
- **Peer-reviewed:** Yes
- **Citations:** Approximately 3,000+
- **Replication status:** Replicated globally; magnetic striping pattern confirmed across all major ocean ridges
- **Summary:** Demonstrates symmetrical magnetic anomaly patterns on either side of mid-ocean ridges, providing the key mechanistic evidence for seafloor spreading. This paper, together with contemporaneous work by others, provided the mechanism Wegener lacked and triggered rapid consensus conversion in geology.

## Evidence Weight Summary

The evidence for plate tectonics is now comprehensive and the paradigm shift is complete. Multiple independent lines of evidence converge: geometric fit of continental margins, fossil and rock type distribution across oceans, paleoclimate indicators placing present-day polar regions in tropical zones, seafloor magnetic striping patterns demonstrating spreading, earthquake and volcanic activity distribution matching plate boundaries, GPS measurements directly observing continental movement in real time. The fixed-continent model is not a competing hypothesis — it has been replaced. This topic is included because the fifty-year gap between Wegener's hypothesis and its acceptance is one of the most instructive cases in the history of science.

## Falsification Prompt

**This topic documents a completed falsification event.**

The prior hypothesis — continents are fixed; ocean basins are permanent features — generated the following predictions:
- Fossil and rock type distributions across oceans should be explicable by land bridges or independent evolution
- Ocean floor should be ancient and compositionally similar to continental crust
- No systematic patterns in seafloor topography or magnetism should correlate with continental positions

**Each prediction was disconfirmed:**
- Fossil and rock type distributions matched across continental margins in ways land bridge hypotheses could not fully explain
- Ocean floor proved young relative to continents and compositionally distinct (basaltic)
- Systematic magnetic striping patterns on ocean floors were inexplicable without seafloor spreading

**The continental drift hypothesis generated the following predictions:**
- Continental margins should show geometric complementarity
- Fossil species and rock formations should match across ocean basins at former junction points
- Ocean floor should be youngest at mid-ocean ridges and oldest near continental margins
- Magnetic striping should be symmetrical around mid-ocean ridges

**Each prediction was confirmed.**

**Pedagogical note:**  
The Wegener case adds a dimension beyond simple Popperian falsification. The hypothesis was correct, and significant evidence supported it from 1912 onward. Rejection persisted for fifty years primarily because no mechanism was known. This illustrates Lakatos's point that evidence alone does not determine theory acceptance — the structure of the research programme, including what counts as a sufficient explanation, shapes what evidence is considered decisive.

## Open Questions

- What determines when a mechanism requirement becomes a legitimate scientific criterion versus a barrier to paradigm revision?
- How should the fifty-year delay in acceptance of continental drift affect evaluation of currently rejected hypotheses with supporting evidence but no known mechanism?
- Are there currently marginalized hypotheses that resemble the pre-1963 status of continental drift?
- What role did geography and institutional context play in the differential acceptance of Wegener's hypothesis in Southern versus Northern Hemisphere geology?

## Why This Topic Is in Context Engine Lab

This topic is included as part of the overturned-consensus series. Its primary purpose is to make the *process* of scientific revision visible and concrete, with particular attention to how mechanism requirements interact with evidence evaluation.

The Wegener case demonstrates:
- That correct hypotheses can face sustained expert rejection for reasons other than lack of evidence
- That the requirement for a plausible mechanism is a legitimate but not always sufficient reason for skepticism
- That paradigm shifts can occur rapidly once a missing element is supplied
- That the sociology of science — institutional structures, national traditions, professional identity — shapes the pace of consensus revision

This is what the scientific method looks like from the inside, over fifty years.
