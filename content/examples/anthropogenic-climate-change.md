## One-Line Summary

The claim that human activity — primarily fossil fuel combustion — is the dominant cause of observed global warming since the mid-20th century; among the highest-consensus positions in contemporary natural science, though policy responses remain contested on normative grounds.

## Forewarning Assessment

**Forewarning Box: DISPLAY**

> *"This topic is frequently presented in media and political contexts as a debate between equally supported scientific positions. The peer-reviewed evidence base is substantially asymmetric. The scientific question — is human activity causing warming? — and the policy question — what should be done? — are distinct. Disagreement about the latter does not imply uncertainty about the former."*

---

## Consensus Messaging

> *"Approximately 97–99% of actively publishing climate scientists endorse the consensus position on human-caused warming. Source: Cook et al. (2013), meta-analysis of 11,944 abstracts; Lynas et al. (2021), review of 88,125 studies. Last updated: 2021 (Lynas et al.)."*

## Primary Sources

### Source A
- **Citation:** IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Working Group I (2021). *Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis.* Cambridge University Press.
- **Year:** 2021
- **Peer-reviewed:** Yes (synthesis of thousands of peer-reviewed studies)
- **Citations:** Foundational document; cited by thousands
- **Replication status:** Meta-analysis exists; core findings replicated across multiple independent research groups globally
- **Summary:** Concludes it is "unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land." Provides quantified attribution of warming to human activities.

- **Year:** 2011
- **Peer-reviewed:** Yes
- **Citations:** Approximately 200
- **Replication status:** Core claims not replicated; multiple published responses identify methodological concerns
- **Summary:** Argues for lower climate sensitivity than mainstream models predict. Represents a minority position within climate science.

## Evidence Weight Summary

The evidence base is substantially asymmetric. Thousands of independent studies across multiple methodologies — ice cores, sea level records, atmospheric measurement, paleoclimatology, ocean heat content — converge on the same conclusion. The minority position has not been replicated and has received significant methodological criticism in the peer-reviewed literature. Weight of evidence strongly favors the consensus position on the empirical question of causation. Policy responses involve normative judgments about intergenerational equity, economic trade-offs, and risk tolerance that the scientific evidence does not resolve.

## Research History Timeline

| Period | Event | Significance |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| ~350 BCE | Aristotle describes climate variation and human-landscape interaction | Early conceptual link between human activity and local climate |
| 1824 | Fourier describes Earth's atmospheric heat retention | First quantitative treatment of the greenhouse effect |
| 1896 | Arrhenius calculates CO₂ doubling effect on global temperature | First quantitative prediction of anthropogenic warming |
| 1938 | Callendar demonstrates rising CO₂ correlating with temperature increase | First empirical linkage of industrial emissions to observed warming |
| 1957–58 | Keeling begins continuous atmospheric CO₂ measurement at Mauna Loa | Establishes human-origin CO₂ increase as empirical fact |
| 1979 | Charney Report (National Academy of Sciences) estimates climate sensitivity 1.5–4.5°C | Range that remains largely unchanged in subsequent assessments |
| 1988 | IPCC established; Hansen testifies to U.S. Congress | Scientific-political interface formalized |
| 1990s–2000s | Multiple independent attribution studies converge | Paradigm shift: debate moves from "is it happening" to "what are the impacts" |
| 2021 | IPCC AR6: "unequivocal" human causation stated | Strongest attribution language in IPCC history |

## Falsification Prompt

**If the human causation claim is correct, we would expect to observe:**
- Atmospheric CO₂ rising in correlation with fossil fuel consumption trajectories
- Stratospheric cooling concurrent with tropospheric warming — the greenhouse fingerprint, distinct from solar forcing
- Arctic warming faster than the global average
- Ocean heat content increasing over time

**If the human causation claim is incorrect, we would expect to observe:**
- Warming patterns consistent with solar variation rather than greenhouse fingerprint
- CO₂ changes following rather than preceding temperature changes
- No correlation between emissions trajectories and temperature trajectories

**Note:** The stratospheric cooling / tropospheric warming fingerprint is considered one of the strongest distinguishing pieces of evidence between human greenhouse forcing and natural variability. It has been observed.

## Open Questions

- Climate sensitivity range (1.5–4.5°C per CO₂ doubling): the upper end remains uncertain
- Tipping point thresholds: ice sheet collapse, permafrost methane release — timing and reversibility uncertain
- Regional impact distribution: global averages obscure significant regional variance
- Carbon cycle feedbacks under high-emissions scenarios: magnitude not fully characterized
