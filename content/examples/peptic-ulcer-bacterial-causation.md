## One-Line Summary

The discovery that peptic ulcer disease is caused primarily by *Helicobacter pylori* bacterial infection — overturning decades of consensus that ulcers were caused by stress and excess stomach acid — is one of the clearest modern examples of a well-evidenced scientific claim facing sustained resistance before eventually achieving consensus.

## Forewarning Assessment

**Forewarning Box: DO NOT DISPLAY**

*Rationale: This topic is not susceptible to false-balance presentation. The prior consensus (stress causation) has been overturned and the current consensus (bacterial causation) is not contested in the scientific literature. The pedagogical value of this topic lies in the history of resistance to a correct finding, not in presenting two current positions.*

## Consensus Messaging

> *"H. pylori infection is now established as the primary cause of peptic ulcer disease. Eradication of H. pylori with antibiotic treatment leads to ulcer healing and dramatically reduces recurrence rates. Source: Marshall & Warren (1984); NIH Consensus Conference (1994). This represents a completed paradigm shift — the prior stress-and-acid consensus has been replaced."*

## Primary Sources

### Source A
- **Citation:** Marshall, B.J. & Warren, J.R. (1984). Unidentified curved bacilli in the stomach of patients with gastritis and peptic ulceration. *The Lancet*, 323(8390), 1311–1315.
- **Year:** 1984
- **Peer-reviewed:** Yes
- **Citations:** Approximately 8,000+
- **Replication status:** Replicated extensively; causal relationship confirmed by multiple independent research groups; Koch's postulates satisfied
- **Summary:** First published report identifying curved bacilli (later named *Helicobacter pylori*) in gastric biopsies of patients with gastritis and peptic ulcers. Initial submission was rejected by peer reviewers. Eventual publication triggered significant resistance from the medical community before replication confirmed the findings.

### Source B

- **Year:** 1995
- **Peer-reviewed:** Yes
- **Citations:** Several thousand
- **Replication status:** Summary of replicated evidence base at time of writing; subsequently further confirmed
- **Summary:** Review by Marshall summarizing the accumulated evidence for H. pylori as the causal agent for peptic ulcer disease, written after the NIH Consensus Conference formally endorsed the bacterial causation hypothesis. Documents the trajectory from initial rejection to consensus.

## Evidence Weight Summary

The evidence for bacterial causation is now overwhelming and the paradigm shift is complete. Multiple lines of evidence converge: bacteriological isolation and characterization, epidemiological association, Koch's postulates satisfied through deliberate self-infection (Marshall, 1984), randomized controlled trials demonstrating that antibiotic eradication heals ulcers and prevents recurrence, and population-level data showing ulcer recurrence rates falling dramatically with eradication therapy. The prior stress-and-acid model is not a competing hypothesis — it has been replaced. This topic is included not because the evidence is contested, but because the history of resistance to this evidence is pedagogically significant.

## Research History Timeline

| Period | Event | Significance |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1800s | Gastric acid identified as factor in ulcer formation | Foundational observation that shaped a century of misdirected treatment |
| Early 1900s | "No acid, no ulcer" becomes clinical dogma | Sippy diet, antacids, vagotomy surgery established as treatments |
| 1950s–70s | Stress and lifestyle framing dominates | Psychosomatic model gains influence; ulcer as "executive disease" |
| 1979 | Warren first observes curved bacilli in gastric biopsies | Initial observation; significance not yet understood |
| 1981 | Marshall joins Warren; culture of bacilli achieved | Technical breakthrough enabling further study |
| 1983 | Marshall presents findings at Gastroenterological Society of Australia | Abstract accepted; presentation receives skeptical reception |
| 1984 | Marshall & Warren: *The Lancet* publication | Initial peer review rejection; eventual publication after revision |
| 1984 | Marshall self-infects with H. pylori culture | Deliberate self-experiment to satisfy Koch's postulates; develops gastritis; treats with antibiotics |
| 1985–1993 | Replication studies accumulate internationally | Resistance from medical establishment gradually erodes as evidence accumulates |
| 1994 | NIH Consensus Conference formally endorses bacterial causation | Institutional recognition; antibiotic treatment becomes standard of care |
| 2005 | Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine: Marshall & Warren | Recognition of discovery 21 years after initial publication |

## Falsification Prompt

**This topic documents a completed falsification event.**

The prior hypothesis — peptic ulcers are caused primarily by excess stomach acid, stress, and lifestyle — generated the following predictions:
- Reducing acid production should heal ulcers and prevent recurrence
- Addressing stress and lifestyle factors should reduce ulcer incidence
- No infectious agent should be consistently present in ulcer tissue

**Each prediction was partially correct but insufficient:**
- Acid reduction healed ulcers temporarily but recurrence rates remained high
- Stress reduction had limited and inconsistent effects
- *H. pylori* was consistently present — the observation that broke the prior model

**The bacterial hypothesis generated the following predictions:**
- *H. pylori* should be detectable in the majority of peptic ulcer patients
- Antibiotic eradication of *H. pylori* should heal ulcers
- Eradication should dramatically reduce recurrence rates

**Each prediction was confirmed:**
- H. pylori present in approximately 90% of duodenal ulcer patients
- Antibiotic treatment heals ulcers
- Recurrence rates fall from approximately 80% per year to under 10% after eradication

**Pedagogical note:**  
This is an example of falsification working as described by Popper — a prior hypothesis generating predictions that were tested and found insufficient, replaced by a new hypothesis whose predictions were confirmed. The delay between evidence and acceptance illustrates Kuhn's observation that paradigm shifts encounter resistance even when evidence is strong.

## Open Questions

- What determines the pace of paradigm shift resistance? Why did H. pylori acceptance take a decade despite strong evidence?
- What proportion of gastric cancers are attributable to H. pylori and preventable through eradication?
- Are there ulcer cases not attributable to H. pylori or NSAID use that require further mechanistic explanation?
- What lessons does this case offer for evaluating resistance to novel findings in contemporary medicine?

## Why This Topic Is in Context Engine Lab

This topic is included as part of the overturned-consensus series. Its primary purpose is not to document a current controversy — there is none — but to make the *process* of scientific revision visible and concrete.

The Marshall and Warren case demonstrates:
- That correct findings can face sustained rejection from established experts
- That self-experiment, replication, and accumulation of converging evidence can eventually overcome resistance
- That the gap between evidence and institutional acceptance can span years or decades
- That Nobel recognition can arrive more than twenty years after the initial finding

This is what the scientific method looks like from the inside.
