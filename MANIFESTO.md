# Manifesto

## We are Pro-Method. Not Pro-Science.

Scientific consensus changes. Methods persist more stably than conclusions.  
We are committed to the method: falsifiability, reproducibility, transparency, tentativeness.

We are not committed to any particular set of conclusions — including currently dominant ones.

## Bias is Human-General, Not Faction-Specific

Anti-science bias and pro-science bias are both forms of motivated reasoning.  
We apply the same structural scrutiny to both.

There is no side that is exempt from cognitive bias.  
There is no position that is immune to identity-protection, confirmation bias, or ingroup preference.

This is not a both-sides-ism claim about evidence.  
It is a claim about the universality of human cognition.

## The Scientific Method is Not a Set of Answers

It is a set of practices:

- Forming falsifiable hypotheses
- Designing reproducible tests
- Reporting transparently, including failures
- Holding conclusions tentatively, subject to revision

We want to make these practices *visible* — not as abstract principles, but as living human struggle.  
The history of science is a history of being wrong, and updating.

## Science Has Been Wrong Before. That Is the Point.

Continental drift was rejected for decades. Peptic ulcers were thought to be caused by stress until Marshall and Warren demonstrated bacterial causation — and faced years of resistance. The universe was assumed to be static until Hubble, and assumed to be decelerating until Perlmutter, Schmidt, and Riess.

These are not failures of science. They are science working.  
We make this visible because the tentativeness of current consensus is easier to accept when the history of revision is concrete.

## AI is Not an Authority

Any AI output in this project is:

- Hypothetical, not authoritative
- Subject to error (publicly logged)
- One perspective among many (cross-AI comparison available)

The disclaimer at the foot of every AI output:

> *Based on the AI Non-Authority Principle. This output is hypothetical. Prioritize primary sources and metadata. Make your own judgment.*

## The Unresolved Problems Are Part of the Work

This project maintains a public list of unresolved issues.  
They are not failures awaiting resolution.  
They are structural features of an honest epistemic project.

See [`docs/unresolved-issues.md`](docs/unresolved-issues.md).

## What We Are Building

A space where people across positions can doubt their own cognition.

Not a space where one side wins.
