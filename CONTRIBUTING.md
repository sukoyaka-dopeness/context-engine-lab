# Contributing to Context Engine Lab

## Before You Contribute

Read the [Manifesto](MANIFESTO.md). Especially this part:

> Structure exposure only. No ridicule. No forced conversion. No binary truth framing.

Contributions that argue for a position rather than exposing structure will be redirected.

## What You Can Contribute

### 1. Topic Content
Add or expand a topic in `content/examples/`.  
Use the template in `content/templates/topic-template.md`.

Required fields:
- `claim_type` tag (empirical / interpretive / normative / conspiratorial)
- `epistemic_domain` tag
- At least two primary sources with metadata (peer_review, year, citations, replication_status)
- Research history timeline (minimum 3 entries)

### 2. Tag Review
Flag incorrectly tagged content by opening an Issue with the label `tag-review`.  
Community voting on disputed tags is part of the moderation model.

### 3. Unresolved Issues
Propose approaches to open problems listed in `docs/unresolved-issues.md`.  
Open a Discussion thread, not a PR, for unresolved issues — solutions require community deliberation.

### 4. AI Error Log
If you find a factual error in AI-generated content, open an Issue with the label `ai-error`.  
Include: the erroneous claim, the correct information, and a primary source.

### 5. Research History Additions
Extend the historical timelines in topic files.  
Accuracy and source citation are required. Interpretive framing should be minimal.

## What We Ask

- Cite primary sources, not secondary summaries
- Label your epistemic position if relevant (empirical claim / interpretive claim / normative claim)
- If you feel strongly about a topic, that is useful information — but separate your position from the structural contribution
- Correction is valued more than certainty here

## A Note on AI-Generated Content

Initial content for many topics was generated by AI.  
All such content is labeled: *[AI-generated — verification and correction welcomed]*

Errors in AI-generated content are not embarrassments. They are data.  
Correcting them is a primary contribution type.
