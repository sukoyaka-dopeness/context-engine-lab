# Context Engine Lab

**Epistemic Literacy Enhancement Project**

> This is not a Science Victory Project.  
> This is an Epistemic Method Visibility Project.

## What is this?

Context Engine Lab is an open platform designed to reduce cognitive stagnation, promote productive self-doubt across all positions, and make the scientific method visible as a living process — not a set of conclusions.

It does not tell you what to believe. It exposes the structure of how beliefs are formed, contested, and revised.

---

## What this is NOT

- A debunking site
- A fact-checking authority
- A pro-science propaganda platform
- An AI authority

---

## Core Goals

- **Reduce Cognitive Stagnation** — Help users encounter the structure of disagreement, not just its content
- **Promote Self-Doubt Across Positions** — Symmetrically. Anti-science bias and pro-science bias are treated as equally worth examining
- **Make Scientific Method Visible** — Falsifiability, reproducibility, tentativeness, paradigm shifts — as lived experience, not abstract principle

---

## Design Principle

> Structure exposure only. No ridicule. No forced conversion. No binary truth framing.

The goal is to reduce thought-stagnation — not to defeat opponents.

---

## Starting Topics

Initial content focuses on cases where scientific consensus was once different from what it is today — moments where the method worked, and beliefs were correctly updated. These cases make the tentativeness of science tangible rather than abstract.

Examples: the bacterial cause of peptic ulcers (Marshall & Warren), continental drift (Wegener), the accelerating expansion of the universe (Perlmutter, Schmidt, Riess).

All initial content is AI-generated and labeled as such. Verification and correction are the first contributions we welcome.

## Status

This project exists at the boundary between **manifesto**, **specification**, and **media art**. It is a thought experiment that aims to be realizable. The unresolved issues are not bugs — they are part of the structure.

See [`docs/unresolved-issues.md`](docs/unresolved-issues.md) for the full list of open problems.

## AI Relay Process

This project was developed through a multi-AI discussion relay:  
`ChatGPT → Copilot → Claude (Anthropic)`

The relay record is preserved in [`ai-relay/`](ai-relay/). This process is itself a demonstration of the project's core claim: structural verification through multiple perspectives.
