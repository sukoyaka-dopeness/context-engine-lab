# Design Principles

## Core Principle: Structure Exposure Only

> No ridicule. No forced conversion. No binary truth framing.

The goal is to reduce thought-stagnation — not to defeat opponents.  
Exposing the structure of a belief is not the same as condemning it.

## False Balance Mitigation Stack

Four layers work together:

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Weight of Evidence Visualization — asymmetry visible at a glance |
| 2 | Consensus Messaging (conditional) — quantified consensus with source, where appropriate |
| 3 | Forewarning Box — pre-emptive inoculation against false-balance impression |
| 4 | Falsification Prompt — shifts from accusation to inquiry |

No single layer is sufficient. The stack is designed to be redundant.

## The Mirror / Gym Question

This project holds productive tension between two models:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Mirror** | Passive reference. Reflects structure back to users. Non-coercive. |
| **Gym** | Active intervention. Trains epistemic habits. Goal-oriented. |

**Current resolution: both, with explicit layer separation.**

- Public-facing content = Mirror (archive, structured, non-prescriptive)
- Participation layer = Gym (tasks, badges, experiment posting)

This is the Wikipedia model: clean surface, active discussion layer beneath.  
The two layers have different ethics, different failure modes, and different relationships to user agency. Keeping them structurally separate makes those differences visible.

## Epistemic Pain as Meaning, Not Obstacle

The experience of having a belief challenged is uncomfortable.  
This discomfort is not a bug to be engineered away with rewards or gamification.

**Design goal:** Give the discomfort a place to exist.

**Method:** Connect the experience to accounts from scientists and researchers describing when their hypotheses were falsified. The message is not "stop feeling bad." It is:

> *"The discomfort you are feeling is evidence of intellectual honesty. It is what updating feels like."*

This is not dopamine substitution. It is meaning provision through relatedness.  
The discomfort is not converted. It is given context.

## Intelligence Redefined

In this community, the highest-status cognitive action is:

> Admitting you were wrong.

Not: being right the first time.  
Not: having more citations than the other person.  
Not: identifying the flaws in someone else's reasoning.

This is a cultural design choice. It must be reinforced consistently across every interface element, every badge, and every default state.

## AI-Generated Content as Starting Point, Not Authority

Initial content is often AI-generated. This is:
- Disclosed explicitly on every AI-generated item
- Treated as a starting point for community verification
- A demonstration of the AI Non-Authority Principle in practice

Label: *[AI-generated — verification and correction welcomed]*

Errors in AI-generated content are data, not embarrassments.  
They are correctable through the same tag-review and community voting system as any other content.

## Meta-Layer Transition Rule

When a first-order discussion reaches impasse, the system may transition to a meta-level discussion about *why* the impasse exists.

**Trigger condition:** First-order discussion is demonstrably stalled — repeated position statements, no new evidence introduced, escalating rhetoric indicators.

**Implementation:** UI auto-suggests transition.
> *"This discussion appears to have reached an impasse pattern. Would you like to see the meta-layer?"*

**Constraint:** Meta-layer is available only on trigger, not by default.  
Frequent meta-escapes read as avoidance. The rule must be visible and consistently applied.

## Metatransparency

When this project uses a design mechanism to influence user behavior — forewarning box, cool-down rate limiting, auto-meta-suggestion — that mechanism is documented publicly in this repository.

Users can inspect every intervention this platform makes on their cognition.  
This is the minimum standard for a project about epistemic integrity.
