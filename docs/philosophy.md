## The Symmetry Rule

Anti-science bias and pro-science bias receive identical structural scrutiny.

This is not a claim about the equivalence of evidence.  
This is a claim about the universality of motivated reasoning.

A platform that scrutinizes one side while exempting the other is not an epistemic literacy platform. It is a partisan platform with better citations.

## Philosophy of Science References

This project draws on the following tradition:

**Karl Popper** — Falsifiability as the criterion of scientific claims.  
A claim that cannot in principle be falsified is not a scientific claim.

**Thomas Kuhn** — Paradigm shifts. Science does not progress linearly.  
Normal science operates within a paradigm until anomalies accumulate and a revolution occurs.

**Imre Lakatos** — Research programmes. Scientific theories exist in clusters with protective belts.  
Falsification is more complex than Popper suggested.

**Paul Feyerabend** — Methodological pluralism. "Anything goes" as a description of how science actually works historically.  
No single method has driven all scientific progress.

The implication: falsifiability alone is insufficient. Science is historically and methodologically plural.  
We make this visible rather than pretending otherwise.

## AI Non-Authority Principle

AI outputs in this project are:

1. **Hypothetical** — not authoritative statements of fact
2. **Uncertain** — uncertainty must be disclosed
3. **Public error log maintained** — errors are recorded and versioned
4. **Cross-AI comparable** — users can view similar queries run on other AI systems

**Why this matters:**  
Curation is authority. Whatever is included, framed, or tagged carries implicit endorsement regardless of disclaimers. We make this structural problem visible rather than pretending the disclaimers solve it.

**Standard footer for all AI-generated content:**
> *AI Non-Authority Principle applies. This output is hypothetical. Prioritize primary sources and metadata. Make your own judgment.*

## Consensus Display Policy

Consensus messaging is displayed **conditionally**:

| Domain | Consensus Display |
|--------|------------------|
| Natural science (high consensus) | ✓ Displayed with source |
| Natural science (contested) | ✓ Displayed with uncertainty noted |
| Social science | Context-dependent |
| Humanities | ✗ Suppressed |
| Philosophy | ✗ Suppressed |

**Why suppress in humanities and philosophy:**  
Displaying consensus in domains where consensus is low, unclear, or itself politically contested induces bias rather than reducing it. Political neutrality requires domain-sensitive handling.
